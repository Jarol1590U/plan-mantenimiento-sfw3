OTP can also fetch real-time data about vehicle rental networks
including the number of vehicles and free parking spaces at each station. We support vehicle rental
systems that use the GBFS standard.

[GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) can be used for a variety of shared mobility services, with
partial support for both v1 and v2.2 ([list of known GBFS feeds](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv)). OTP supports the following
GBFS form factors:

- bicycle
- scooter
- car
